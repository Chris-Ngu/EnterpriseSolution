# EnterpriseSolution
 FullStack implementation of a business solution to keep track and manage co-workers and tasks

Currently WIP with one creator
This program is not used for commercial purposes, this is used to learn different aspects of modular programming such as component integration, networking, and the different aspects that a business would require

If you would like to help out with development or have questions about the project, feel free to contact me on discord @GruntyBunty#3342

# Experimental ideas:

Login with connection to a MYSQL DB

Messanger with different coworkers

Webcam meetups

Display DB information

Email/ messanger notification service

Calender that shows group tasks and events coming up that everyone can see

Virtual LAN to access files and access computers in the same network
