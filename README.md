# EnterpriseSolution
 FullStack implementation of a business solution to keep track and manage co-workers and tasks

Experiental/Dev branch of EnterpriseSolution is Default with the most up-to-date features

Changes will be implemented there before pushed here

Currently using MYSQL and connector/net for VS

This program will not be used for commerical purposes. I am creating this to better understand the concepts of programming, such as modular implementation, networking, and the basic technological needs of an innovating business. If you would like to understand this concept or would like to help in development, please contact me on Discord: GruntyBunty#3342

# Experimental ideas in the works

Management system of co-workers/ branch

Integrated messanger for group and individuals with filesharing (maybe screen sharing in the future)

Public calander system for branch/ individual events that can be seen by everyone

Email system used for registration, notifications, or any other purposes

music player that detects audio files in selected folders to play client side
